# SegoeHUD
TF2 Interface similar of Windows OS.
This was the projet called JofreHUD before being a FPS focused.
WARNING: This HUD is still on early development! Really! 

# INSTALLING - HIGH PRIORITY
1.- Go to your gameinfo.txt (is located at tf/)
2.- Found this line:  "game+mod+custom_mod	tf/custom/*"
3.- And add this:
	  	game+mod+custom_mod	tf/!new_custom/!segoe/*			
			game+mod+custom_mod	tf/!new_custom/!hud/*
			game+mod+custom_mod	tf/custom/*
4.- It should look like that, it indicates what stuff is loaded when booted the game
5.- Create a folder on "tf/" with the name "!new_custom" and then "!segoe" & "!hud"
6.- Put SegoeHUD on !segoe
7.- Put JofreHUD on !hud
8.- Finished!

# HUD Structure
Well! This is the first ever implementation of JofreHUD I made!

Most of it its like MagnumHUD.
