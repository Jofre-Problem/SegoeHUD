//proxies that work
// https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/List_Of_Material_Proxies
// calculation: all
// generation: Sine, LinearRamp, UniformNoise, GaussianNoise, Playerspeed - most other ones initialize but don't work on the hud without an entity to tie it to
// manipulation: AnimatedTexture, TextureTransform - not sure about TextureScroll - the rest don't work on the hud
// entity integration: none on the hud
// utility: the empty proxy doesn't initialize, but that's the point
// game specific: all initialize but afaik none work on the hud

//useful vmt vars to manipulate
//	"$color"	"[1.0 1.0 1.0]"
//	"resultVar"		"$basetexturetransform"
//	"$alpha"		"1.0"
//can also create your own variables to do some math on

//not a whole lot, but the three main things then are:
// rotating, changing color, or changing alpha
// all being continuously changing, or based on player speed
//and also animated vtfs but that doesn't really count
